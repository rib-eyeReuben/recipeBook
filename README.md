idk what this is supposed to do, but I think that I'm going to make a
small html website that just has a recipe in it with some photos nothi-
ng too crazy.  Then when I learn CSS I should go back over it and fix 
up the website, and clean it up a bit.  Should have a picture, link(bo-
th types), and some strong text and such.:
